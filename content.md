## Projects:

### BFL

At Kalyani Group, I have developed full-stack autonomy solutions for ground-based robotic platforms including quadrupeds (unitree go2, b2), humanoids (untiree g1), and customized wheeled mobile robots. My work spans the perception-to-control pipeline, with a focus on real-time autonomy, fleet interoperability, and architecture design for robust communication system. I have developed modular autonomy stack with 3D LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) mapping & localization, along with multi-terrain navigation for indoor, semi-structured and shop floor factory environments. Built and deployed Hardware Abstraction Layers (HAL) for heterogeneous robotic platforms to ensure portability across actuator/sensor configurations and standardize control interfaces. Designed multi robot communication architecture to connect fleet of robots through a dashboard and enable remote mission dispatch, health monitoring, and state feedback. Additionally, designed a fleet management system capable of multi-robot coordination, monitoring, and remote control — supporting real-time interoperability between multiple ground units in shared environments.

### flytbase
In an internship at FlytBase Labs, I contributed towards the development of an autonomous drone operations platform for Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) missions. Focused on designing middleware components deployed on edge devices embedded in drones for reliable long-range, real-time communication and control. Developed micro-services for autonomous waypoint navigation, failsafe execution, and health monitoring, communicating over MQTT and integrated with FlytBase’s cloud platform. Implemented mission planning modules using MAVROS and PX4 APIs, enabling real-time trajectory updates and mission re-routing. Designed robust recovery mechanisms including battery-critical RTL (Return-to-Launch), GPS loss detection, and failsafe state transitions via action servers and service clients. Contributed to the full stack — from on-board firmware interaction to high-level service orchestration — enabling globally accessible drone fleet control for applications in logistics, surveillance, and industrial monitoring.

### Robocon
Designed and developed two semi-autonomous robot systemas, part of the DD National ABU Robocon 2022 Robotics Challenge. The competition theme required multi-robot coordination to complete complex, time-sensitive tasks involving precise navigation, object manipulation, and real-time strategy execution. Led the software architecture for the autonomous robot, focusing on robust low-level motion control, multi-sensor data fusion, and reactive state-based behavior planning. Implemented high-frequency control loops for 3-wheeled omni drives using PID and feedforward velocity control. Integrated encoder and IMU data through a complementary filter for odometry estimation, with fallback localization via vision-based trained object model tracking. Designed finite state machines (FSMs) for task sequencing and time-critical transitions, enabling real-time adaptability during match scenarios with sub-50 ms control latency.

### CL Theme
Designed and developed the “Cosmo Logistic” theme for the e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) 2023–24, conducted by IIT Bombay. The project involved the integration of a mobile robot and a UR5 robotic arm to autonomously sort and prepare packages in a simulated inter-planetary warehouse environment. As the theme developer, I engineered the complete pipeline — from autonomous navigation and object localization to coordinated manipulation. Implemented a ROS 2-based system combining SLAM for localization, the Nav2 stack for navigation, and MoveIt for motion planning and manipulation. The system was first validated in the Gazebo simulator and later deployed on physical hardware at IIT Bombay for end-to-end testing. This theme was designed for national-level deployment, enabling students across India to solve advanced mobile manipulation problems using a realistic robotics stack.

### Robot Arm Actuator
Designed and fabricated a compact, high-torque actuator for robotic arms operating under heavy-load conditions. The actuator integrates a NEMA-17 stepper motor coupled with a 10:1 custom gear reduction system, achieving a peak torque output of 42 kg·cm at the elbow joint. The system was optimized for minimal footprint and mechanical efficiency through torque transmission analysis, backlash minimization, and bearing load evaluations. Housing and gear components were modeled in SolidWorks and fabricated using aluminum alloy for strength-to-weight optimization. This actuator provides a modular solution for precision-controlled joint motion in industrial and research-grade robotic manipulators.

### Humanoid
Led the mechanical design of a humanoid robot’s upper body with a focus on precision actuation and compact form factor. Developed a 2-DOF parallel manipulator for neck movement, capable of ±30° pitch and ±45° yaw with sub-degree repeatability. Designed custom linear actuators for the shoulder joint using a 14:1 gear reduction system. Performed detailed gear train calculations, load analysis, and actuator sizing to ensure smooth motion under varying load conditions. Created fully dimensioned 2D manufacturing drawings using SolidWorks, incorporating GD&T and tolerances within ±0.05 mm for CNC milling and laser-cut profiles. The system was fabricated using aluminum for structural components and PLA for non-load-bearing 3D printed parts. The project aimed to improve humanoid upper body dexterity through optimized actuator placement and precise kinematic control.



## About Me - V2 - Full intro

I'm an incoming Fall '25 Master's student (MechE) at the University of Washington.

I build robotic systems that reason, adapt, and act in the messy real world — solving non-trivial problems in dynamic environments. My interests lie at the intersection of autonomy, control, and learning, with a particular excitement for robots that move through space (mobile robots, quadrupeds, arms-on-wheels) and make sense of it along the way.

Currently, I'm a Robotics Engineer at Kalyani Group, developing autonomy stacks for quadrupeds and humanoids — from perception pipelines to real-time control and multi-robot communication systems. Before this, I spent a year at the ERTS Lab, IIT Bombay, as a Project Assistant under Prof. Kavi Arya, where I worked on lightweight grasping algorithms and an integrated mobile manipulation system for automated warehouse tasks. I also led nationwide training in robotics and embedded systems for over 100 faculty and 1300+ students, reinforcing my commitment to accessible robotics education.

I bring a grounded engineering background (B.Tech in Production Engineering, VIT Pune) and got my start in robotics by building and breaking things — custom actuators, humanoids with 3D-printed joints, drone middleware for BVLOS operations. Some of these led to podium finishes at the Smart India Hackathon and ABU Robocon; others ended in flying gears and burned stepper motors (equal learning on both ends).

In the long run, I want to build robots that solve non-trivial problems in dynamic environments — whether that’s a warehouse full of unpredictably placed packages or an unstructured off-road trail with no GPS and plenty of mud.
