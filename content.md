## Projects:

### CL Theme
Designed and developed the “Cosmo Logistic” theme for the e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) 2023–24, conducted by IIT Bombay. The project involved the integration of a mobile robot and a UR5 robotic arm to autonomously sort and prepare packages in a simulated inter-planetary warehouse environment. As the theme developer, I engineered the complete pipeline — from autonomous navigation and object localization to coordinated manipulation. Implemented a ROS 2-based system combining SLAM for localization, the Nav2 stack for navigation, and MoveIt for motion planning and manipulation. The system was first validated in the Gazebo simulator and later deployed on physical hardware at IIT Bombay for end-to-end testing. This theme was designed for national-level deployment, enabling students across India to solve advanced mobile manipulation problems using a realistic robotics stack.

### Robot Arm Actuator
Designed and fabricated a compact, high-torque actuator for robotic arms operating under heavy-load conditions. The actuator integrates a NEMA-17 stepper motor coupled with a 10:1 custom gear reduction system, achieving a peak torque output of 42 kg·cm at the elbow joint. The system was optimized for minimal footprint and mechanical efficiency through torque transmission analysis, backlash minimization, and bearing load evaluations. Housing and gear components were modeled in SolidWorks and fabricated using aluminum alloy for strength-to-weight optimization. This actuator provides a modular solution for precision-controlled joint motion in industrial and research-grade robotic manipulators.

### Humanoid
Led the mechanical design of a humanoid robot’s upper body with a focus on precision actuation and compact form factor. Developed a 2-DOF parallel manipulator for neck movement, capable of ±30° pitch and ±45° yaw with sub-degree repeatability. Designed custom linear actuators for the shoulder joint using a 14:1 gear reduction system. Performed detailed gear train calculations, load analysis, and actuator sizing to ensure smooth motion under varying load conditions. Created fully dimensioned 2D manufacturing drawings using SolidWorks, incorporating GD&T and tolerances within ±0.05 mm for CNC milling and laser-cut profiles. The system was fabricated using aluminum for structural components and PLA for non-load-bearing 3D printed parts. The project aimed to improve humanoid upper body dexterity through optimized actuator placement and precise kinematic control.



## About Me - V2 - Full intro

I'm an incoming Fall '25 Master's student (MechE) at the University of Washington.

I build robotic systems that reason, adapt, and act in the messy real world — solving non-trivial problems in dynamic environments. My interests lie at the intersection of autonomy, control, and learning, with a particular excitement for robots that move through space (mobile robots, quadrupeds, arms-on-wheels) and make sense of it along the way.

Currently, I'm a Robotics Engineer at Kalyani Group, developing autonomy stacks for quadrupeds and humanoids — from perception pipelines to real-time control and multi-robot communication systems. Before this, I spent a year at the ERTS Lab, IIT Bombay, as a Project Assistant under Prof. Kavi Arya, where I worked on lightweight grasping algorithms and an integrated mobile manipulation system for automated warehouse tasks. I also led nationwide training in robotics and embedded systems for over 100 faculty and 1300+ students, reinforcing my commitment to accessible robotics education.

I bring a grounded engineering background (B.Tech in Production Engineering, VIT Pune) and got my start in robotics by building and breaking things — custom actuators, humanoids with 3D-printed joints, drone middleware for BVLOS operations. Some of these led to podium finishes at the Smart India Hackathon and ABU Robocon; others ended in flying gears and burned stepper motors (equal learning on both ends).

My work focused on researching and developing lightweight grasping pipeline algorithms for picking unknown objects and designing a theme-based project for automated packaging and sorting in warehouse-like environments. Alongside research, I delivered hands-on robotics and embedded systems training to over 100 faculty and mentored 1300+ students nationwide — an experience that deepened my belief in building open, accessible platforms for robotics education.

## About Me - V0

I am an incoming Fall '25 Master's student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington, where I aim to build intelligent robotic systems that reason, adapt, and act in the messy real world. My interests lie at the intersection of autonomy, control, and learning — with a particular excitement for robots that move through space (mobile robots, quadrupeds, arms-on-wheels) and make sense of it along the way.

Right now, I'm a Robotics Engineer at Kalyani Strategic Systems, where I work on real-world autonomy stacks for quadrupeds and humanoids — from designing robust perception pipelines to crafting real-time control and multi-robot communication systems. Before this, I spent a year at e-Yantra, IIT Bombay, integrating grasping algorithms with mobile manipulators and teaching hundreds of students and faculty the magic of embedded robotics.

Some of these led to podium finishes at Smart India Hackathon and ABU Robocon; others ended in flying gears and burned stepper motors (equal learning on both ends).

As I step into UW, I bring a grounded engineering background (BTech in Production Engineering, VIT Pune), a deep respect for well-designed systems, and a growing curiosity for how classical control and learning-based methods can co-exist in harmony.

In the long run, I want to build robots that solve non-trivial problems in dynamic environments — whether that’s a warehouse full of unpredictably placed packages or an unstructured off-road trail with no GPS and plenty of mud.

If any of that sounds exciting to you — let’s connect!
