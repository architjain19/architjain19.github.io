## About Me - V2 - Full intro

I'm an incoming Fall '25 Master's student (MechE) at the University of Washington.

I build robotic systems that reason, adapt, and act in the messy real world — solving non-trivial problems in dynamic environments. My interests lie at the intersection of autonomy, control, and learning, with a particular excitement for robots that move through space (mobile robots, quadrupeds, arms-on-wheels) and make sense of it along the way.

Currently, I'm a Robotics Engineer at Kalyani Group, developing autonomy stacks for quadrupeds and humanoids — from perception pipelines to real-time control and multi-robot communication systems. Before this, I spent a year at the ERTS Lab, IIT Bombay, as a Project Assistant under Prof. Kavi Arya, where I worked on lightweight grasping algorithms and an integrated mobile manipulation system for automated warehouse tasks. I also led nationwide training in robotics and embedded systems for over 100 faculty and 1300+ students, reinforcing my commitment to accessible robotics education.

I bring a grounded engineering background (B.Tech in Production Engineering, VIT Pune) and got my start in robotics by building and breaking things — custom actuators, humanoids with 3D-printed joints, drone middleware for BVLOS operations. Some of these led to podium finishes at the Smart India Hackathon and ABU Robocon; others ended in flying gears and burned stepper motors (equal learning on both ends).

Before this, I spent a year at the Embedded Real-Time Systems Laboratory, IIT Bombay, as a Project Assistant under Prof. Kavi Arya. My work focused on researching and developing lightweight grasping pipeline algorithms for picking unknown objects and designing a theme-based project for automated packaging and sorting in warehouse-like environments. Alongside research, I delivered hands-on robotics and embedded systems training to over 100 faculty and mentored 1300+ students nationwide — an experience that deepened my belief in building open, accessible platforms for robotics education.

## About Me - V0

I am an incoming Fall '25 Master's student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington, where I aim to build intelligent robotic systems that reason, adapt, and act in the messy real world. My interests lie at the intersection of autonomy, control, and learning — with a particular excitement for robots that move through space (mobile robots, quadrupeds, arms-on-wheels) and make sense of it along the way.

Right now, I'm a Robotics Engineer at Kalyani Strategic Systems, where I work on real-world autonomy stacks for quadrupeds and humanoids — from designing robust perception pipelines to crafting real-time control and multi-robot communication systems. Before this, I spent a year at e-Yantra, IIT Bombay, integrating grasping algorithms with mobile manipulators and teaching hundreds of students and faculty the magic of embedded robotics.

I got my start in robotics by building and breaking things — custom actuators, humanoids with 3D printed joints, drone middleware for BVLOS operations. Some of these led to podium finishes at Smart India Hackathon and ABU Robocon; others ended in flying gears and burned stepper motors (equal learning on both ends).

As I step into UW, I bring a grounded engineering background (BTech in Production Engineering, VIT Pune), a deep respect for well-designed systems, and a growing curiosity for how classical control and learning-based methods can co-exist in harmony.

In the long run, I want to build robots that solve non-trivial problems in dynamic environments — whether that’s a warehouse full of unpredictably placed packages or an unstructured off-road trail with no GPS and plenty of mud.

If any of that sounds exciting to you — let’s connect!
